# Predator-Prey Simulation
This program simulates different animals in a food chain. We can track and visualize the population as animals get eaten by other animals and as animals reproduce.\
Currently this program has four different animals - Fox, Rabbit, Deer, and Bear

# Animal Class
Each animal has certain attributes associated with it that affect whether it is a predator or a prey\
_BREEDING_AGE_\
_MAX_AGE_\
_BREEDING_PROBABILITY_\
_MAX_LITTER_SIZE_\
_age_\
_alive_\
_location_\
These variables affect the state of the animal, the reproduction rate, and how long the animal will survive for. 

# Simulation
This program runs a visualization with a color of a pixel on the grid being associated with a certain animal. Each animal starts off with a certain amount of population. There is also a graph of the populations of all the animals as the simulation runs.\
